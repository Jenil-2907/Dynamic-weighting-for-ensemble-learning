# Dynamic Weighting for Ensemble Learning

This project explores an effective approach to **ensemble learning using dynamic weighting**, applied to **plant leaf disease detection**.  
Instead of assigning fixed weights to individual models, the ensemble dynamically adjusts weights based on model performance to improve overall prediction accuracy.
